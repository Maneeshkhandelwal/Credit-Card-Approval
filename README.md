# Credit-Card-Approval

Credit card approval is a crucial process for banks and financial institutions. The traditional approach to credit card approval involves manual verification of the applicant’s details, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. In recent years, machine learning techniques have been used to automate the credit card approval process and improve its accuracy.

In this project, we aim to predict whether a credit card application will be approved or not based on the applicant’s details. We will use a dataset containing information about past credit card applications to train our machine learning model.

We will use various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests,etc to build our model. We will evaluate the performance of each algorithm using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Our goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict credit card approval and help financial institutions streamline their credit card approval process.
